# Project in molecular Life science (KB8024/KB8025)
This contains my project for the course.

Clone the whole repository with all the files, for codes to work.

For my Final predictor- It is saved in the codes directory under the name "Final_predictor.py"

It contains two models, which are the SVC and the PSSM_SVC. It is testing on the file 50unknown proteins (see datasets). All my fasta files for training as well as testing are saved in fasta_data along with each and every PSSM profile.

All the paths for the Final predictor have been defined, hence just running it would be sufficient. Though it takes sometime to run so PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE! Since my model consists of training on 60 proteins and is running on 50 proteins to predict, it will take time. Have patience!!

The validation scores and the predicted texts are written into files saved in the Predicted Texts directory. These files end with "final50.txt" format.
