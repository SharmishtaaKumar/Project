So now I had predictor which was taking one input sequence and returning one output sequence successfully. My next step was to train the model on multiple sequences. For the same I had to change part of my code from the start. I had to change my parser such that it can take multiple sequences as input and add the padding for the same. Now my model could successfully train on multiple sets and return the topology for a sequence(test).
