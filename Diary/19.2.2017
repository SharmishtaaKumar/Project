19th February
I continued doing the git tutorial, created my account on github and a repository as the tutorial suggested, and named my repo as "New-Project". Then I cloned the repo onto my computer and also pushed all the practice session files into the repo.
For the project in particular I made a new repo and sent the John the link to my SU-project repo.
I also extracted my dataset and parsed it successfully into a nested dictionaries, the key being the id's and the sequences being the value one and the topology being the value two.
