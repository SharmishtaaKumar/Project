SO i am running the decision tree and the random forest classifier for the same. After i got the result for the same, i trained a model with the best parameters which got me the highest cross_val_score for each of them. I trained them using my test file which contains 60 proteins obtained from the dataset given to me.
 And i created predictors for the same. THe test set was parsed using the same usual predictionparser.py which i had made. Hence the now i predicted on the small test file which is in datasets saved as "test1". The predicted texts for the same are saved in codes folder as "DTpredicted.txt" and "RFCpredicted.txt".
