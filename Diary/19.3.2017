I came to the lab one last time to run all my codes and to upload everything one final time on github.
So my final model consists of two models:- one being the SVC and the other being PSSM SVC model, where the scores and the predictions are written into files. It takes a bit of time to finish running so be PATIENT!!
SO that should be about it....If you clone my repository everything should work. I am updating my README for the same. Works when i cloned my repository onto my computer
