For running cross validation for different window sizes i had to chnage my code respectively for taking in different window sizes. Hence i created another file respectively and defined a function to do cross validation. In this file i imported my previously used function (dataset) and defined the window sizes in between (3,32) with skipping 2 such that only the odd values are taken in as the windows. I ran a small set of my dataset to test if the code works an dgives me the cross validation score. Since it gave me the scores for the small dataset, I ran it on about 60 proteins in my dataset overnight.
