SInce the input vector for the topologie swas ready, i started working on the input for the sequences. The list of sequences parsed from the dataset was already created. SInce each of the amino acids needed to be converted into a set of binaries containing 20 elements using one hot encoding, I create a dictionary where the keys were the amino acids and the binary values for the same were the keys.
I also looked up for five papers which were related to using machine learning or SVM to predict the secondary structure of transmembrane helices. I also worked on the project proposal for the project. I submitted the list of five papers I would like to represent and the project proposal. I also read the paper for the journal club, next day, briefly.
