After creating the dictionary for the particular amino acids and assigning them with binary values, I created sliding windows for the same with a window size of 3. I also added padding for the flanks of the sequence with 0 where each zero denoted the binary value of having 20 zeroes in them. After checking if the sliding windows works properly for the defined size(3), I create the list of the sequences defined by the sliding windows. For this particular list created, i converted each and every element of the list into itss binary form respectively. Then i create dthe numpy array for the same list with all the binary values.
