We have been in the lab from 8 today working all our codes. Since i figured out the sliding windows yesterday, i changed the topology for the same like done previously SVM predictor.
 Hence finally i get both values of x and y sucessfully for the PSSM_parser!!! YAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!
Now i created a model by training over the test dataset of mine with 60 proteins as usual,with the optimum parameters which i got SVM which were window size 31 and the C value and gamma for the same. 
I am running the cross val score for the PSSM_model for the window lengths 25-36, C values 1,5,10 and gamma value 0.01,0.001.
I am also running the cross_val score for decision tree and random forest classifier for the PSSM_profile.
So far the cross_val scor which i got for SVC on PSSM_profile is not goodd. the accracy is supposed to increase but it has dropped way tooooooo much. Shuhan told me to run the cross_val_score across my whole dataset for the same. Since either the score is actually low or my model for the same is wrong!!!!!!!!!!HEIGHTS!!!!!!!!!
So i am running cross_val_score for SVC,decision tree and random forest classifier for my whole dataset in hopes of getting better accuracy scores. I still have to make the predictionparser for the test.
I had to find a dataset of 50 proteins which are not tested upon by me. Hence i searched for what dataset various TM helix secondary structure predictors used. I first cheched for the Moller dataset used by MEMPACK but the link for the same didn't work!!!!!!!! Hence i searched for TOPCONS.......and VOILA i got the dataset which was MY OWN!!!! i now know where i got the dataset from!!!!
Hence NOW i tried to get it from TMHMM and YESSS i got the dataset with the actual predicted topology too. Saved it as the50 text in my codes folder. Now since it had the prediction also in it, I USED A CODE, yes i couldn't believe it, to parse it. Hence i parsed for only the header and amino acid sequence of the file. This file is 50proteinstobepredicted!!!! YAYA!!!!
So i have the 50 proteins to be predicted.
