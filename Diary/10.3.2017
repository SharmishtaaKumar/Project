its saturday but i still has to do alot of stuff to catch up. SInce now i had an SVM working for multiple sequences, i tried to create decision tree and random forest classifier for the same. Hence i tried out different parameters for the same.

FOR DECISION TREE
I used the parameters of window length varying from 25,36 since my optimum for the SVC was 31 and hence i took ranges before and after that window length. And for the min_sample_split for the same i varied from 2,3,4,5,6,7 and tested for the same values. The results are the saved in the results folder for the same.

FOR RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
Repeated what i did with the window length hence ran from 25,36 and for the other parameters, n_estimators varying from 100,150,200,250,300 and the min_sample_split for the same varied from 2,3,4,5,6,7 and tested for the same values. The results are in the results folder fro the same.
